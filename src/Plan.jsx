            hi <br></br>
            <br></br>
            This website is very much still under construction, and I'm just a junior engineer.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Me working on this code:
            <br></br>

            <img src={constructionGif} className='construction-gif' alt="construction-gif" />

            <br></br><br></br>
            So what am I doing here?
            <br></br><br></br>
            Well, this morning I had the bright idea to make a music player as a portfolio website.
            <br></br><br></br>
            ...even though I have no clue how to make a music player as a portfolio website.
            <br></br><br></br>
            But I suppose that's why it'll be a good challenge.
            <br></br><br></br>
            And the other bright idea I had was to plan it out ON the website. So without further ado:

            <br></br><br></br>
            <h2>Chapter 1: Initial design</h2>
            Since the world is very much mobile now I will optimize for *mobile first*.
            <br></br><br></br>
            *What do I want from this music player?*
            <br></br>
            I want to make a music player that has my latest release. 
            Not only can people play the song but they can also add effects to it.
            The effects should always sound good, there should be no way for the person messing with it to make it ugly.
            After all, it's my job as a music producer and an engineer to curate this experience.
            <br></br>
